# Current Task: Simplify Architecture

## Completed Objectives
1. ✓ Removed OpenRouter integration
2. ✓ Simplified translation management to use static data only
3. ✓ Updated script.js to remove API-related code
4. ✓ Removed unnecessary files:
   - server.py
   - translationService.js
   - config.js
   - requirements.txt
   - .env
   - openrouter-setup.md
5. ✓ Updated documentation to reflect changes

## Context
The flash card application has been simplified to use only static translations stored in words.js. This change reduces complexity and external dependencies while maintaining core functionality.

## Implementation Details
- Removed all OpenRouter-related code and configuration
- Enhanced error handling for missing translations
- Maintained existing UI functionality
- Simplified codebase for better maintainability

## Current State
- Application uses static translations only
- All core features remain functional:
  - Language switching
  - Card navigation
  - Animations
  - Keyboard controls
  - Progress tracking

## Next Steps
The application is now fully functional with static translations. Future improvements could focus on:
1. Adding more static translations to words.js
2. Enhancing UI/UX features
3. Implementing additional language support
